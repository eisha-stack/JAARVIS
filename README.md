# 🌍 Multi-Label Natural Disaster Risk Prediction

A machine learning-based solution to **predict multiple types of natural disasters** and their associated **risk levels** using ensemble learning techniques. This project is designed to aid in **proactive disaster management and risk assessment**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Our final year project focuses on developing a **multi-label classification model** that can accurately predict the likelihood and severity of various natural disasters. The system is built using robust ensemble algorithms and is backed by thorough data preprocessing and evaluation.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 Predicts **multiple disaster types** (e.g., floods, earthquakes, cyclones) simultaneously
- ⚠️ Classifies **risk levels** for better preparedness
- 🧠 Uses **ensemble learning** for higher accuracy and stability
- 🧹 Handles real-world data irregularities like missing values and outliers
- 📊 Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score for reliable results
